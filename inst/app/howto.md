## How to use this App 

### Live mode and Manual mode

The live preview mode allows you to automatically regenerate the hex every time you change one input.

In some rare cases this might make the app a little bit slower, especially if you're playing around with colors, hence the possibility to change this to manual mode. In manual mode, you'll need to click on the render button to see the changes in your image.

### Manage name

This part handles the Name layer. 

### Manage image

Here, you can upload an image from your computer to be used as an image for your sticker. 

Parameters allow you to play with the position and size of the image.

The "Modify" window allows you to perform basic image manipulation using the [`{magick}`](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) package. 

### Manage Hexagon

Change the borders and fill of the hex stickers.

### Manage Spotlight

Here you can parametrize a spotlight on your sticker. 

### Manage URL
